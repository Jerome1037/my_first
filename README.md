#### **This is a classical CNN,which only based on numpy(except dataset).**
#### **The net uses im2col algorithms to acclerate.Using MNSIT as dataset，an epoch which contains 10000 pics costs 3-5mins to train(AMD Ryzen 4800H on Laptop).**
#### **The net also includes save and load function using ".npz" file.**
#### **During 50 epochs train (batchsize 512), the accuracy reach near 98%.**
